# Bteter-UHK
Improving hardcore redim for playing both on a server with friends and in the local world in hardcore mode

# Briefly about the datapack
This datapack is an unusual modification of Hardcore Minecraft, the main differences are that the player(s) initially has not one life but 10 (in proportion to the number of containers of hearts), if containers are lost, they can be replenished with a rather rare item (Enchanted Golden Apple )

## More details on what it looks like in the game
when starting the datapack, all players receive 10 points and 10 lives it looks like this
